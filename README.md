## Technical Information

The website was written using TypeScript v4, Angular v10 and a whole host of other libraries for testing. GitHub Actions was used as part of the CI process to ensure code-hygiene, utilising Angular's built-in testing and linting tools.

## Firing It Up (üî•‚Üë)

To run, test or build the website locally, you'll need to have a few things installed:
 - [x] Node.js (LTS - v12) - [Get it here](https://nodejs.org/)
 - [x] NPM (Bundled with Node.js)
 
Once you've installed Node.js, you'll need to checkout the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thretclothing/home.git
```

After checking out the `develop` branch (The working branch against which all tested, but pre-prod, commits are made against), you'll then be able to install the NPM dependencies needed for the project to run:

```bash
# üö® - Make sure that you've cd'd into the correct directory first
npm install
```

After the dependency installation has completed, you'll be able to use the NPM commands listed below. If you have any questions or issues relating to this process, feel free to [raise an issue here](https://github.com/thretclothing/home/issues).

### Running The Site

There are two ways in which you can launch the site:
- In dev mode, which is what is used when working on the site: `npm run start`
- In prod mode, which resembles the live site: `npm run start:prod`

### Building The Site

There are two ways in which you can build the site, similarly to points above:
- In dev mode, which should only be used in testing environments: `npm run build`
- In prod mode, which is ultimately what is packaged and delivered to web-clients: `npm run build:prod`

### Testing The Site

There are four ways in which you can test the site:
- In a chromium window, running the suite once: `npm run test`
- In a chromium window, running the suite until you exit: `npm run test:watch`
- In a headless chromium window, running the suite once: `npm run test:headless`
- In a headless chromium window, running the suite until you exit: `npm run test:headless:watch`

## Quality Checks and Automation

As part of an effort to ensure code-quality and hygiene, this repository has been equipped with some automating features:
- Each PR that is raised will automatically have `npm run lint` and `npm run test:headless` checked against the branch, to ensure nothing is broken and that the style guide has been adhered to.
- Dependabot has been enabled to ensure that NPM and GitHub Actions dependencies are never outdated within a given scope.
- Stale reviews/approvals on PRs will be removed to ensure no changes are made after-the-fact.
